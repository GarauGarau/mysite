abstract: "This paper examines the impact of mandatory sectoral closures on labor mobility in Italy during COVID-19, using detailed administrative data on employment activations, separations, and contract transformations. We analyze employment flows between essential and non-essential sectors, applying propensity score matching and a weighted difference-in-difference approach. The results reveal significant effects for sectors that were forced to shut down, particularly in increased transitions from employment to unemployment and decrease from unemployment to employment."

This paper examines the impact of mandatory sectoral closures on labor mobility in Italy during COVID-19, using detailed administrative data on employment activations, separations, and contract transformations. We analyze employment flows between essential and non-essential sectors, applying propensity score matching and a weighted difference-in-difference approach. The results reveal significant effects for sectors that were forced to shut down, particularly in increased transitions from employment to unemployment and decrease from unemployment to employment.
