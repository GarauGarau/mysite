## Work in Progress

### 1. **Labour Market Dynamics - Evidence from Administrative Data**
**Authors:** Silvia Balia, Alessio Garau, Daniela Sonedda, Giovanni Sulis  
**Abstract:**  
This paper examines the impact of mandatory sectoral closures on labor mobility in Italy during COVID-19, using detailed administrative data on employment activations, separations, and contract transformations. We analyze employment flows between essential and non-essential sectors, applying propensity score matching and a weighted difference-in-difference approach. The results reveal significant effects for sectors that were forced to shut down, particularly in increased transitions from employment to unemployment and decrease from unemployment to employment.

### 2. **Impact of Technological Innovation on Research Productivity**
**Authors:** Alessio Garau  
**Abstract:**  
This paper investigates whether the introduction of DYNARE, a software used to solve and simulate DSGE models, has impacted productivity and inequality among economics scholars. By comparing publication and citation outcomes between fields more likely to adopt DYNARE and those that did not, we identify differences in research productivity and the distribution of publication success, applying a difference-in-differences approach.
