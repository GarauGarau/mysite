publication_short: "Leaving the field?"

abstract: The core of our work is trying to understand the complex interplay between
technology-driven inequality and productivity disparities, focusing the attention on a particular type of high-skill workers: researchers. This emphasis on scholars is not arbitrary; it is a carefully considered decision based on several factors. The field within each researcher operate can be precisely measured and quantified, providing a ground for robust empirical analysis. Within the context of this question, we are also examining whether such innovations unintentionally perpetuate inequality among workers, or whether they operate as a harmonizing tool that reduces the productivity disparities between less and more talented researchers.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This is a work-in-progress project aimed at understanding the complex relationship between technology-driven inequality and productivity disparities among a particular group of highly skilled workers, researchers. Does technology serve as a leveling field, or does it exacerbate existing differences among high-skilled academic workers?

The core of our work is trying to understand the complex interplay between
technology-driven inequality and productivity disparities, focusing the attention on a particular type of high-skill workers: researchers. Our focus on scholars is intentional and well-founded; it stems from the ability to precisely measure and quantify the field within which each researcher operates, thereby facilitating robust empirical analysis. Within the context of this question, we are also examining whether such innovations unintentionally perpetuate inequality among workers, or whether they operate as a harmonizing tool that reduces the productivity disparities between less and more talented researchers.
