## Introduction

Have you ever tried to explain something tricky, and wished the person could just see inside your mind? That's the [idea behind prompts](https://cdn.openart.ai/assets/Stable%20Diffusion%20Prompt%20Book%20From%20OpenArt%2011-13.pdf) for AI. A prompt is a clear instruction, or direction, to get AI to understand and produce what you want.
Big tech companies are starting to hire folks with humanistic background because they're good at this. They know how to use words in a way that paints clear pictures. And this skill is super useful when you want AI to create a specific image from a description.

The landscape of AI-driven image generation has always been a delicate dance between human input and machine output. Historically, the process required users to supply highly detailed prompts to produce accurate visuals. Take, for instance, the system [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F). To paint a picture of a serene scene, one might have to describe it meticulously:

   {{< figure src="midj.jpg" caption="A Midjourney prompt: The parametric hotel lobby is a sleek and modern space with plenty of natural light. The lobby is spacious and open with a variety of seating options. The front desk is a sleek white counter with a parametric design. The walls are a light blue color with parametric patterns. The floor is a light wood color with a parametric design. There are plenty of plants and flowers throughout the space. The overall effect is a calm and relaxing space. occlusion, moody, sunset, concept art, octane rendering, 8k, highly detailed, concept art, highly detailed, beautiful scenery, cinematic, beautiful light, hyperreal, octane render, hdr, long exposure, 8K, realistic, fog, moody, fire and explosions, smoke, 50mm f2.8" numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}


Yet, the advent of [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3), with its integration into ChatGPT, is ushering in a new era. This technology shows an uncanny ability to *auto-prompt*, or intuitively grasp, the essence of a description.

During these tech advancements, I had an idea for a fun experiment. I've always been a big fan of [Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami). His stories, filled with amazing places and deep feelings, have always captivated me. So, I thought, why not see how DALL·E 3 handles his writings? Can it create pictures that match the dreamy and mysterious worlds Murakami describes? As I went through this experiment, I didn't just learn about what the AI could do, but also thought a lot about how our favorite stories can turn into pictures in our minds—and now, on the screen.

For this experiment, I took a bunch of paragraphs and quotes from  some of my favorite Murakami 's books. From these,  With each chosen passage, I presented it to DALL·E 3 within ChatGPT. Alongside each Murakami quote, I've posted its corresponding AI-generated image where the associate caption is the auto-generated prompt by ChatGPT.

## #1 Kafka on the Shore

Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.

The person's eyes are closed, and they have their hands raised to protect their face. The atmosphere is thick, making it hard to see anything beyond the immediate vicinity." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}

## #2 Men Without Women 

And once you’ve become Men Without Women, loneliness seeps deep down inside your body, like a red-wine stain on a pastel carpet. No matter how many home ec books you study, getting rid of that stain isn’t easy. The stain might fade a bit over time, but it will still remain, as a stain, until the day you draw your final breath. It has the right to be a stain, the right to make the occasional, public, stain-like pronouncement. And you are left to live the rest of your life with that gradual spread of that colour, with that ambiguous outline

   {{< figure src="Murakami2.png" caption="Candid photography of an individual reflecting in solitude. The background captures a room with muted tones and a prominent red-wine stain on the carpet. The scene is a metaphorical representation of the deep-seated loneliness described in the text." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}

## #3 Dance Dance Dance

You gotta dance. As long as the music plays. You gotta dance. Don't even think why. Start to think, your feet stop. Your feet stop, we get stuck. We get stuck, you're stuck. So don't pay any mind, no matter how dumb. You gotta keep the step. You gotta limber up. You gotta loosen what you bolted down. You gotta use all you got. We know you're tired, tired and scared. Happens to everyone, okay? Just don't let your feet stop.

   {{< figure src="Murakami3.png" caption="Cinematic shot of a vast dance floor filled with people of diverse backgrounds and ages. The lighting fluctuates with the rhythm, and amidst the crowd, a central figure stands out, dancing passionately, representing the spirit of never stopping and always pushing forward." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}

## #4 1Q84

The moon had been observing the earth close-up longer than anyone. It must have witnessed all of the phenomena occurring - and all of the acts carried out - on this earth. But the moon remained silent; it told no stories. All it did was embrace the heavy past with a cool, measured detachment. On the moon there was neither air nor wind. Its vacuum was perfect for preserving memories unscathed. No one could unlock the heart of the moon. Aomame raised her glass to the moon and asked, “Have you gone to bed with someone in your arms lately?” The moon did not answer. “Do you have any friends?” she asked. The moon did not answer. “Don’t you get tired of always playing it cool?” The moon did not answer.

   {{< figure src="Murakami4square.png" caption="Cinematic shot of Aomame standing on a city rooftop at night. The vast expanse of the city lights stretches out behind her. She holds a glass, her silhouette defined against the luminous backdrop of the moon, seeking answers from the silent celestial observer." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}


## #5 Sputnik Sweetheart 

Being all alone is like the feeling you get when you stand at the mouth of a large river on a rainy evening and watch the water flow into the sea. Have you ever done that? Stand at the mouth of a large river and watch the water flow into the sea?

   {{< figure src="Murakami5square.png" caption="Cinematic still of the meeting point of a river and the sea during a rainy dusk. A lone figure stands near the water's edge, their posture reflective. The play of light and shadow, combined with the rain, creates a mood of solitude and introspection." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}

## #6 South of the Border, West of the Sun

Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.

   {{< figure src="Murakami66.png" caption="Cinematic still of a close-up of a person's face, their eyes reflecting the twinkling stars from the night sky. The depth and emotion in their gaze hint at a profound connection with someone or something far away, capturing the essence of the described sentiment." numbered="true" width="400" height="400" >}}
