## A bit of a historical introduction

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system that is widely used in the publication of scientific documents, particularly in the fields of mathematics and computer science. It was first developed in the late 1970s by [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), a computer scientist and author who was frustrated with the poor quality of the typesetting in many of the scientific papers he read.

## Asynchronous composition and philosophy

LaTeX is *based on the idea of separating content from presentation*, which means that the author focuses on writing the content of their document, and the LaTeX system takes care of formatting it according to a set of predefined style rules. This approach has several advantages:

- It allows the author to focus on the content of their document, rather than getting bogged down in formatting details.
- It produces documents that are consistently formatted and aesthetically pleasing, *with no need for the author to worry about typography or layout*.
- It makes it easy to change the overall style of a document by simply changing the style rules, rather than having to manually reformat the entire document. 

One of the key features of LaTeX is its ability to handle complex mathematical notation. It includes a wide range of symbols and formatting options for mathematical expressions, making it a popular choice for writing papers in fields such as mathematics, physics, engineering and economics.

## Installation

To use LaTeX, you need to have a LaTeX compiler installed on your computer. There are many free and open-source LaTeX compilers available, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and MiKTeX. Once you have a compiler installed, you can create a LaTeX document by writing your content using the LaTeX markup language and then compiling the document using the compiler. The compiler will produce a typeset document in the form of a PDF or other format, which you can then view or print.

  **Remember**: LaTex is the "language" and should be distinguished from a simple editor or compiler. The latter alone would not be able to reproduce the desired result. Its purpose will only be to provide us with an interface with which to write (and compile) code nimbly.

It should be mentioned that although the full distribution still remains the best option, there is the possibility to start using LaTex even *fully* online thanks to the [Overlaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) site. The fact that no installation is required may further reduce resistance even among the most skeptical users.
In any case, the site still offers excellent templates that can be downloaded and reused offline even by "traditional" users. Finally, Overlaf is in some ways better when the document is part of a project in which several users are working simultaneously.

Although there are several LaTex Editors the two most widely used (offline) remain:

  1. [Text Studio](http://www.texstudio.org/) (Multi platform)
  2. [Tex Shop](http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/) (Mac)
  
## How to write your first document

Since compiling the document will produce different types of files, it is *good practice* to create a folder where you will go to save the body of the document *.tex* and any external elements you might decide to use (images, pdfs, tables...).

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\title{An Introduction to LaTeX}
\author{John Doe}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is widely used in the publication of scientific documents. It is particularly well-suited for handling complex mathematical notation.

\section{The Basics}
To use LaTeX, you write your document in a plain text editor and then run it through a LaTeX compiler to generate a formatted PDF. LaTeX uses a markup language similar to HTML, with commands enclosed in backslashes (\textbackslash). For example, to create a bold heading, you might use the following command:

\textbackslash textbf\{My Bold Heading\}

\section{Conclusion}
LaTeX is a versatile and powerful tool for typesetting scientific documents. With a little bit of learning, it can save you a lot of time and effort in formatting your papers and presentations.

\end{document}


```
This example includes a few basic LaTeX commands:

- `\documentclass{article}` specifies that this is an article-style document.
- `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` mark the beginning and end of the document.
- `\title, \author`, and `\date` are used to specify the title, author, and date of the document.
- `\maketitle` generates the title, author, and date information at the top of the document.
- `\section` is used to create a new section, with the text in curly braces ({}) serving as the section title.

## Make your first Beamer presentation

[Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) is a LaTeX package that allows you to create professional-quality slides for academic presentations. It is a powerful and flexible tool that offers a wide range of formatting options, including support for animations, overlays, and beamer themes.

To use Beamer, you need to have a working LaTeX installation on your computer. You can then create a Beamer presentation by using the `\documentclass{beamer}` command at the top of your LaTeX document, and then writing your content using a combination of Beamer commands and standard LaTeX.

Here is a simple example of a Beamer presentation:
```{=latex}
\documentclass{beamer}

\title{An Introduction to Beamer}
\author{John Doe}
\institute{University of Example}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is Beamer?}
Beamer is a LaTeX package for creating professional-quality slides for academic presentations. It offers a wide range of formatting options and is easy to use.
\end{frame}

\section{Creating a Basic Slide}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Basics}
To create a basic slide, you can use the following template:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{My Slide Title}

My slide content goes here.
\end{frame}
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary}
- Beamer is a powerful and flexible tool for creating academic presentations.
- It offers a wide range of formatting options and is easy to use.
- With a little bit of practice, you'll be creating beautiful slides in no time!
\end{frame}

\end{document}

```

This example includes the following Beamer commands:

- `\documentclass{beamer}` specifies that this is a Beamer presentation.
- `\title`, `\author`, `\institute`, and `\date` are used to specify the title, author, institute, and date of the presentation.
- `\maketitle` generates the title, author, institute, and date information at the top of the first slide.
- `\section` is used to create a new section, with the text in curly braces ({}) serving as the section title.
- `\begin{frame}` and `\end{frame}` mark the beginning and end of a slide.
- `\frametitle` is used to specify the title of a slide.
